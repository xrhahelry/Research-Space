\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
In today's digital age, the abundance of academic literature can be overwhelming
for researchers and upcoming students seeking relevant information. Finding relevant
papers in specific domains is increasingly challenging due to the volume of
publications and the lack of efficient tools for personalized recommendations. Also
in fields like AI the velocity of new publications is so high that if you are not
reading everyday you fall behind. To address this challenge, an academic research
recommendation can streamline the process by utilizing citation networks and
semantic search for promising discovery processes, while the LLMs can provide
unprecedented capabilities in information retrieval and summarization.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Current academic research platforms struggle to provide relevant paper
recommendations due to limitations in traditional keyword-based search methods.
These methods often fail to account for the detailed relationships between papers,
leading to information overload and inefficiency in literature discovery. Also many
papers don't explain the information that they learned from the documents they
have cited. This makes research tedious as to understand one academic paper you
will have to read multiple other papers too.

\subsection{Objectives}
The project aims to transform how researchers navigate and engage with academic
literature by developing an LLM-powered system that integrates citation networks,
knowledge graphs, and user-centric design. Our project aim to fulfill the following tasks:
\vspace{-25pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To retrieve papers relevant to user queries using a hybrid approach.
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \item Rank recommendations based on citation impact and semantic similarity.
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \item Explain papers using GraphRag.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motivation and Significance}
We ourselves have been reading or trying to read academic papers to understand AI
and its current advancements but we have found that current academic research platforms
like google scholar, arxiv, etc are not so easy to use if we want to read the cited
papers as well. For that we found connected papers to be slightly better as it
visualises the paper as a graph with its cited papers but understanding the paper
completely is still a challenge and using LLMs like chatgpt, deepseek only gives
partially correct or sometimes completely wrong answers.

\section{Related Works}
Doe (2022) proposed a hybrid recommendation framework for scientific article
recommendation by constructing a large-scale citation network comprising 190,381
articles from 70 journals spanning statistics, econometrics, and computer science
from 1981 to 2022. The framework integrates network-based citation patterns with
content-based semantic similarities. To enhance content-based recommendations,
OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model was employed to generate embedding vectors
for article abstracts, ensuring computational efficiency and embedding stability
for handling dynamic academic databases.

Smith and Johnson (2023) explored the complementary nature of content-based
filtering (CBF) and graph-based methods (GB) in academic search recommendations.
They described how CBF analyzes abstracts to infer authors’ positions, while GB
examines citations to capture audience responses. Their study identified nine key
differences between CBF and GB, highlighting synergistic opportunities for hybrid
approaches. Notably, they utilized two embedding techniques: Specter, a BERT-based
model for encoding abstracts, and ProNE, a spectral clustering-based method applied
to over 200M papers and 2B citations from Semantic Scholar.

\section{Design and Implementation}
\subsection{Data Collection}
Datasets will be collected from reliable sources like arXiv using their public API,
Semantic Scholar’s S2ORC. After the dataset has been collected most of it will
already be in structured format except the PDFs of the papers. For the pdfs we will
parse and extract relevant textual information from it.

\subsection{Graph Construction and Storage}
\subsubsection{Citation Graph}
The citation graph represents papers as nodes and citation links as directed edges,
where an edge from Paper A to Paper B indicates that A cites B. This graph will be
implemented using NetworkX for rapid prototyping and small-scale analysis or Neo4j
for handling larger datasets with efficient querying capabilities.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{citationgraph.png}
    \caption{Example citation graph with dummy nodes}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Knowledge Graph}
Knowledge Graph will extend the citation graph by incorporating additional
information: author networks (edges between co-authors), subject networks(edges
to papers of the same subject), and topic embeddings (vector representations of
paper content derived from paper). This multi-layered graph provides a holistic
view of academic connections, enabling more nuanced retrieval by linking papers
through authors, and topics beyond direct citations.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{knowledgegraph.png}
    \caption{Example knowledge graph with dummy nodes}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Text-Content Graph}
For each paper, a Text-Content Graph will be constructed from its full text
(title, abstract, and body) to capture intra-paper semantic relationships. Key
entities and concepts (e.g., "vision transformer," "healthcare," "deep learning")
will be extracted as nodes using SciBERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and
KeyBERT for keyphrase identification. Edges will be defined based on relationships
identified through multiple methods: co-occurrence (entities appearing in the same
sentence or paragraph, weighted by frequency), dependency parsing (syntactic
relationships like "vision transformer improves healthcare," labeled accordingly),
and semantic similarity (cosine similarity between SciBERT embeddings of entities
exceeding a threshold, e.g., 0.8). These graphs will be built using NetworkX for
in-memory processing, with each node representing an entity/concept and each edge
reflecting a contextual or syntactic link within the paper.

\subsubsection{Semantic Embeddings}
Semantic representations will be generated for the entire text of each paper
(title, abstract, and body) to fully capture its content and context. SciBERT,
a transformer model fine-tuned on scientific texts, will process the full text
in segments (e.g., 512-token chunks) due to its input constraints, producing
contextual embeddings (768-dimensional vectors) for each segment. These will be
averaged across segments to create a single content-based embedding per paper,
reflecting its scientific meaning. Simultaneously, TransE will embed each paper
based on its position in the knowledge graph, generating structural embeddings
(e.g., 100-dimensional vectors) that encode relationships like citations and
co-authorships. For each paper, the SciBERT and TransE embeddings will be combined
(e.g., concatenated or weighted) into a unified vector representation. These vectors
will be stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search. The full corpus
approach ensures richer representations, capturing details from methods, results and
discussions. The database will be updated incrementally as new papers are added,
recomputing embeddings only for new documents to maintain scalability.

\subsection{Generating Recommendation}
\subsubsection{Citation-Based Search}
This approach of generating recommendation is a path based approach where we will
simulate random walks on the citation graph and the papers with the most visits will
be recommended to the user. This approach ensures we suggest he most relevant paper.

\subsubsection{Semantic Search}
Semantic Search queries the vector database using a user input, embedding it with
SciBERT, and retrieving the top K papers based on cosine similarity of content
embeddings, supplemented by TransE embeddings for rational alignment. Using these
embedding will compute similarity measures and recommend the most relevant papers.

\subsubsection{Ranking}
Each candidate is scored using a weighted combination including Citation strength,
SciBERT similarity and TransE Similarity. The top K papers are selected according
to need.

\subsection{GraphRAG Integration}
GraphRAG leverages the Text-Content Graph to enable the LLM to chat with the content of a single PDF paper, providing an interactive question-answering feature.The text-content graph constructed from the paper’s full text captures intra-paper semantic relationships. The graph comprises nodes as key entities and concepts and edges as relationships. Alongside this, the paper’s SciBERT embeddings, which encode the full-text content into 768-dimensional vectors, are included to provide detailed semantic context. The LLM processes this hybrid input within the Graph RAG framework, reasoning over the text-content graph’s structure and the embeddings’ semantic depth. When a user poses a question, the LLM traverses the graph to identify relevant relationships and uses the embeddings to extract precise content, generating a natural language response. This integration empowers users to explore a paper’s content interactively, offering a conversational interface.

distributing the tasks to each member of the group . We are planning to work on our own
on the weekdays and gather on the project day to discuss and compile the codes
collectively. The following Gantt chart shows the time allocation for different aspects of
our project
\newpage

\section{Expected Outcome}
The expected outcome of this project is a web application designed to revolutionize academic literature discovery. The system will employ a hybrid approach that combines citation networks and knowledge graphs to retrieve papers relevant to user queries. Recommendations will be ranked based on citation impact and semantic similarity, ensuring both influential and contextually relevant papers are prioritized. Additionally, the integration of GraphRAG will enable users to interactively explore and understand the content of papers, enhancing their research experience. By addressing the limitations of current academic search platforms, this project aims to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of literature discovery for researchers and students alike.
